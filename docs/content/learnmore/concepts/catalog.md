In OSCAL, a catalog is:

> A set of security and/or privacy [controls](../control/). Examples of catalogs include NIST SP 800-53, ISO 27001, and COBIT. The *catalog model* in OSCAL refers to any data made available for processing in one of OSCAL's formats for representing catalog information.

An OSCAL catalog is a set of OSCAL controls published as a machine readable document. The catalog for NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-53 Revision 4 defines all NIST SP 800-53 controls. Other catalogs can represent controls of any kind, design or purpose.

If your organization has a document or formal specification that would benefit from expression in OSCAL (to be used either separately in its own profile or implementation stack or along with NIST SP800-53 controls), the OSCAL team would like to [hear from you](mailto:oscal@nist.gov).

See [examples](/documentation/schema/catalog/examples/) of OSCAL catalogs.

The OSCAL Plan of Action and Milestones (POA&M) model is part of the [OSCAL Results Layer](/documentation/schema/assessment-results-layer/). It defines structured, machine-readable XML, JSON, and YAML representations of the information contained within a POA&M. 

This model is used by anyone responsible for tracking and reporting compliance issues or risks identified for a system, typically on behalf of a system owner. 

This model supports details typically associated with a POA&M, including source of discovery, risk description and recommendations, remediation planning/tracking, and disposition status. It also supports deviations, such as false positive (FP), risk acceptance, and risk adjustments (RA).

An OSCAL POA&M is always defined in the context of a specific system. It must either be associated with an OSCAL [System Security Plan (SSP)](/documentation/schema/implementation-layer/system-security-plan/), or reference a system by unique identifier.

The current version of this model was created based on the information requirements of a [FedRAMP POA&M](https://www.fedramp.gov/assets/resources/templates/FedRAMP-POAM-Template.xlsm). 
It was designed to use identical syntax to the [assessment results model](/documentation/schema/assessment-results-layer/assessment-results/), for overlapping assemblies (results: observations and risks), which allows easy transfer of identified risks for an assessment report to a POA&M.

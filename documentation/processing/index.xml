We call this profile resolution.
Reading these specificationsTerminologyThese DRAFT specifications take the form of a tag set mapping between the OSCAL profile and OSCAL catalog XML document models. The same mapping (transformation from source to target) can be effected using other expressions of the OSCAL model such as JSON or YAML object serializations. In these specifications, XML terminology is used, with reference to XML constructs such as element and attribute, with examples given using XML syntax: these however are for illustrative purposes only and normative only with respect to the semantic mapping, not the syntax as such.</description></item></channel></rss>

The validation information is represented as a separate component, which is then linked to any component on which the validation was performed.
For example, this approach can be used with a product containing a cryptographic module that has received a FIPS 140-2 validation by a NIST accredited laboratory. The product is represented as one component, and the validation information is represented in a different component.</description></item></channel></rss>

    <p>NISO STS is an XML-based document model being adopted within the community of
        Standards Development Organizations (SDOs) for encoding technical standards.
        Since OSCAL has XML foundations, and STS is also XML-based and designed to use the
        same or a similar stack of standards-conformant tools, they are highly
        compatible.</p>
    <p>However, the two data models are designed to cater to the needs of very different
        data professionals. While STS documents are published for a specific audience or market,
        OSCAL data (with the exception of public catalogs) is not likely to ever be "published",
        while at the same time it will be exchanged among parties for purposes of analysis,
        integration, and assessment, all of which are activities with semantics
        the encoding should support. Consequently, the design of the OSCAL data models,
        and of applications based on them, must enable different work than traditional
        editorial and publishing workflows aimed at document production.</p>
    <p>Due to their commonalities and potential overlap, however, STS and OSCAL (whether
        catalog, implementation- or assessment-related or other exchangeable data) can be
        used together. For example, dropping OSCAL data into an STS-based system, to support
        editing and production in a published form, would be a simple exercise in XML
        transformation pipelining.</p>

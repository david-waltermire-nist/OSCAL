    <p>NISO STS is an XML-based document model being adopted within the community of
        Standards Development Organizations (SDOs) for encoding technical standards.
        Since OSCAL has XML foundations, and STS is also XML-based and designed to use the
        same or a similar stack of standards-conformant tools, they are compatible in
        many respects and share many characteristics.</p>
    <p>However, the two data models are designed to cater to the needs of very different
        data professionals. STS is focused on the formal publication of technical standards,
        while OSCAL is focused on presenting a subset of (relatively) highly structured
        data from those standards and from other documents, for the purposes of integration
        with security automation and assessment support.</p>
    <p>Due to their commonalities and potential overlap, however, STS and OSCAL (whether
        catalog, implementation- or assessment-related or other exchangeable data) can be
        used together. For example, dropping OSCAL data into an STS-based system, to support
        editing and production in a published form, would be a simple exercise in XML
        transformation pipelining. Or it may be found useful to author and edit documents
        in STS for purposes of their publication, and then produce an OSCAL version of
        those documents or parts of them, to expose to systems that can use OSCAL.</p>

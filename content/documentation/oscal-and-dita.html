    <p>OSCAL will be a good fit with documentary systems based <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darwin_Information_Typing_Architecture"
        >Darwin Information Typing Architecture (DITA)</a>. The issues will be similar
        to integrating with STS or JATS â€“ whether or where to embed one in the other
        (probably OSCAL into DITA), or alternatively to map and enforce semantics across a
        bridge. </p>
    <p>Since OSCAL is designed to be easier than most formats to map into other formats, the
        OSCAL team is interested in collaborating in this area.</p>

    <p>Microsoft's Office Open XML is the format underlying its Word and Excel applications;
        it is documented as ISO. Ubiquitous as an application format, these formats are tractable
        using tools built to the applications' APIs and data models, but they are not designed
        to support application-independepent data exchange. OSCAL enables
        greater data interoperability among disparate systems by capturing the semantics of
        controls, independent of how they may be displayed using various representations
        (such as word processors). However, we expect that word processors and spreadsheets 
        will continue to be used in workflows supporting OSCAL, supported where necessary
        by data conversion utilities.</p>

    <p>XML has been widely used in many industries. Wherever XML data repositories exist
        that could benefit from an OSCAL description, some sort of functional mapping to an
        OSCAL-based format is possible.</p>
    <p>However, XML is only one vehicle. To the extent that relevant data sets exist
        (whether in standardized or non-standardized form), OSCAL can provide translation
        and serialization services, leveraging formats including JSON or YAML, to expose this data in a
        standards-compliant way to downstream applications and services.</p>

    <p>The <a href="https://www.niso.org/standards-committees/jats">National Information
        Standards Organization (NISO) Journal Article Tag Suite (JATS)</a> was
        originally developed at the US National Library of Medicine and the National
        Institute of Health for the aggregation of large numbers of journal articles in
        online text bases. While it is not as close to the application domain of OSCAL as
        the <a href="https://www.niso.org/standards-committees/sts">NISO Standards Tagging
            Suite (STS)</a> (which is built on the JATS architecture), it presents similar
        opportunities for integrators. <a href="https://jats.nlm.nih.gov/extensions/bits/"
            >NLM Book Interchange Tag Suite (BITS)</a> is the related data description
        standard for monograph and book publication.</p>

Promote review of draft OSCAL 1.0.0 documentation and formats ahead of finalizing OSCAL 1.0.0</p><p>This development phase focused on producing:</p><ul><li>Updated stable versions of <a href=https://pages.nist.gov/OSCAL/documentation/schema/catalog-layer/catalog/>catalog</a> and <a href=https://pages.nist.gov/OSCAL/documentation/schema/profile-layer/profile/>profile</a> models which provide a structured representation of control catalogs and baselines or overlays.</li><li>Updated stable version of the <a href=https://pages.nist.gov/OSCAL/documentation/schema/implementation-layer/ssp/>system security plan</a> model which provides a structured representations of a system's control-based implementation. This model has been enhanced to support documenting how controls from an existing authorized system can be leveraged in another information system, which supports common control provider and platform as a service (PaaS) use cases.</li><li>Updated stable version of the <a href=https://pages.nist.gov/OSCAL/documentation/schema/implementation-layer/component/>component definition</a> model which provides a structured representation of the controls that are supported in a given implementation of a hardware, software, service, policy, process, procedure, or compliance artifact (e.g., FIPS 140-2 validation).</li><li>Revised drafts of the <a href=https://pages.nist.gov/OSCAL/documentation/schema/assessment-layer/assessment-plan/>assessment plan</a>, <a href=https://pages.nist.gov/OSCAL/documentation/schema/assessment-results-layer/assessment-results/>assessment results</a>, <a href=https://pages.nist.gov/OSCAL/documentation/schema/assessment-results-layer/poam/>plan of action and milestones</a> (POA&M) models, which support the structured representation of information used for planning and documenting the results of an information system assessment or continuous monitoring activity. These models have been enhanced to better support continuous assessment; to provide more traceability between the assessment schedule, specific assessment activities, collected data, and resulting findings and identified risks; and to improve the extensibility of these models.</li><li>Updated tools to convert between OSCAL <a href=https://github.com/usnistgov/OSCAL/tree/master/xml>XML</a> and <a href=https://github.com/usnistgov/OSCAL/tree/master/json>JSON</a> formats, and to <a href=https://github.com/usnistgov/OSCAL/tree/master/src/release/content-upgrade>up convert</a> content from milestone 3 to RC1.</li></ul><p>These changes were made based on all the excellent feedback we received from the OSCAL community.

Planned</p><p><span class=usa-tag>Focus</span>
Publish an OSCAL 1.0.0 Specification</p><p>To accelerate the development of OSCAL, we are not focused on developing a formal specification for OSCAL until the final OSCAL 1.0.0 milestone. Until then, the OSCAL models are <a href=https://pages.nist.gov/OSCAL/documentation/schema/>documented</a> on this site. This will allow us to work on a formal specification once most of the major development of OSCAL is completed. For now, adopters of OSCAL will find all of the resources they need to develop content and tools on this site.</p><h3 id=beyond-the-oscal-100-full-release>Beyond the OSCAL 1.0.0 Full Release</h3><p>We will continue to address any defects, improve documentation, and add features where possible over a series of minor and defect fix releases. Minor releases will be be indicated as <code>1.x.0</code>, where <code>x</code> will be incremented for each minor release. This may include backporting features being worked on in the OSCAL 2.0.0 release epics. Defect fix releases will be indicated as <code>1.x.y</code>, where <code>x</code> will be the current minor release and <code>y</code> will be incremented for each defect fix release. This will allow adopters to benefit from releases against a stable and supported OSCAL v1, while we work on significant new features in OSCAL v2.</p><h2 id=oscal-v2>OSCAL v2</h2><p>Similar to OSCAL v1, the second major version of OSCAL, OSCAL v2, will be developed over a series of milestone releases. We have not yet planned a specific number of milestones in the OSCAL v2 epic. We will start planning OSCAL v2 as are near wrapping up the <a href=#oscal-1-0-0-full-release>final development milestone</a> of OSCAL v1.</p><h3 id=oscal-200-milestone-1>OSCAL 2.0.0 Milestone 1</h3><p><span class=usa-tag>Development Milestone</span>

Further development of the OSCAL Assessment and Assessment Results models.</p><p>The OSCAL Assessment and Assessment Results layers of the OSCAL architecture will continue to be developed as part of the OSCAL 2.0.0 release. This phase of development will focus on integrating automated means of collecting assessment data using existing assessment technologies.</p><p>This assessment development work has been split from the earlier OSCAL v1 epic to allow a stable version of OSCAL formats to be released and maintained that provide a solid foundation for publishing control catalog and baseline information, and to allow organizations to automate the documentation, maintenance, and human-focused assessment of system implementations. This will allow tool vendors to develop against stable OSCAL v1 releases, while ongoing development of OSCAL v2 continues.</p></article></div></div></div></main><p class="font-sans-sm text-center" style="margin:1.5rem auto">This page was last updated on April 8, 2021. <button id=main-improve-page onclick="window.location.href='https:\/\/github.com\/usnistgov\/oscal-content\/tree\/master/contribute\/roadmap.md';" class="usa-button usa-button--accent-cool">Improve this Page</button></p><script src=https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/tocbot/4.4.2/tocbot.min.js integrity=sha384-S2Sj9dbj135Vzm4xwOrcyOA/FlODQj514E6Il+ayOB/Y0YClPg5BpCy7lG2G8wtV crossorigin=anonymous></script><script type=text/javascript src=https://pages.nist.gov/OSCAL/js/site.min.js integrity="sha512-jQyHaE6yz/5a3qAMJZ/QxGXQSotKG9mrQEqxgyXRilAQeH5muW+znGxYOy63LqwTbcl8sPNRosqdROMtsHsIKA=="></script><script>$(document).ready(function(e){});tocbot.init({tocSelector:'#js-toc',contentSelector:'#main-content',headingSelector:'h2,h3,h4',includeHtml:false,collapseDepth:0,hasInnerContainers:true,orderedList:false,listClass:'usa-sidenav',listItemClass:'toc-item',extraLinkClasses:'usa-sidenav__item',activeLinkClass:'usa-current'});</script><script type=text/javascript src=https://pages.nist.gov/leaveNotice/js/jquery.leaveNotice-nist.min.js></script><script>$(document).ready(function(){$('a[href*="//"]:not([href*="pages.nist.gov"]):not([href*="www.nist.gov"]):not([href^="#"]):not([href^="/"])').addClass('usa-link usa-link--external');$('a.usa-link--external').leaveNotice();});</script><script>anchors.options={placement:'left'};anchors.add();</script></body></html>

# OSCAL Utilities

Utilities offered include XSLT stylesheets (XSLT 3.0 for performance/power or XSLT 1.0 to run in a browser); CSS stylesheets; XProc pipelines and (a little) XQuery. Nothing here is authoritative as models are still evolving.

## [author](author)

At present, contains CSS applicable to OSCAL in an authoring environment (such as an XML editor supporting CSS styling)

## [convert](convert)

XSLT transformations for converting XML OSCAL into JSON OSCAL and vice versa. These transformations are machine-written from metaschema inputs. See [metaschema source](../../metaschema) for the metaschema inputs and [metaschema build support](../../../build/metaschema) for the mechanics.

## [lib](lib)

Various and miscellaneous utilities, in various stages of documentation and polish.

## [publish](publish)

Transformations (stylesheets) for converting OSCAL catalogs or (resolved) profiles into published outputs such as HTML and markdown.

## [resolve](resolve)

An XSLT transformation that provides for resolution of OSCAL profiles into catalog-like XML documents. Under development.

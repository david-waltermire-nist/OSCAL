The OSCAL Project has made the following releases:

OSCAL 1.0.0 Milestone 1
-----------------------
- The first official OSCAL release
- Provides stable versions of the OSCAL catalog and profile models in XML and JSON formats, along with associated XML and JSON schemas.
- Includes draft versions of the NIST SP 800-53 revision 4 OSCAL content and FedRAMP baselines in OSCAL XML, JSON, and YAML formats.
- Provides content converters that are capable of accurately converting between OSCAL catalog and profile content in OSCAL XML to OSCAL JSON format and vice versa.

OSCAL 1.0.0 Milestone 2
-----------------------

# New OSCAL Features

- A System Security Plan (SSP) model has been added to OSCAL for use by organizations to document the implementation of security and privacy controls in an information system.

# Breaking Changes

The following content model changes have been made to the catalog and profile models that may break content compatibility:

## Document metadata

  * `last-modified` is now required. Its value must be a date-time with time zone (i.e., a timestamp). The old element `last-modified-date` is no longer permitted.
  * `published` is permitted for a nominal publication date, as assigned by the owner or publisher of the catalog or resource. An electronic version of a previously published catalog should carry its own publication date, if any, not that of the original resource (which can be described elsewhere with its own metadata).
  * `role-id` is now assigned as an element in the XML, not an attribute. This permits it to be tokenized more explicitly.

## Control structures in the catalog model

### New property in SP800-53 catalog data

In the SP800-53 catalog, we have added a property called `sort-id` to controls and enhancements. Its string value represents the control's ID in a (zero-padded) notation that will sort gracefully against other `sort-id` values. This permits a robust reordering of controls in receiving systems without having to refer to an out-of-line document to restore the canonical order.

### Controls inside controls, but no "subcontrols"

Control enhancements are now represented using `control` not `subcontrol`. The advantages of restricting to two levels of hierarchy (even given groups and parts) became too few in view of the sacrifices to expressiveness so we have gone back to clean recursion.

## Data type handling

Data type handling has been extended in several respects to provide for the validating of lexical forms of nominal datatypes. Datatypes for dates and times have been added. Several XML-peculiar datatypes have been removed.

### Value enumeration on terminal nodes

The schema has also been extended to support validation against enumerated values, either exclusively (only declared values may appear) or inclusively (enumerations are documented while other values are also permitted). All allowed values now being declared (Milestone 2) are inclusive of other values (user- or application-defined), so this is not a breaking change.

Affected data points (in both models): `prop/name`, `address/type`, `phone/type`, `hash/algorithm`, `role-id`. The enumerated values provided for each are documented.

### Lexical datatyping at points

Supported for lexical datatyping has also been added to `link/href`, `rlink/href` (URI references), `published` and `last-modified` (timestamps), `email` (a nominal email address), `url` (a URI), `img/src`.

## Profile model enhancements

### Calling control enhancements (old "subcontrols")

From call statements, since `subcontrol` has been dropped from the catalog model, `subcontrol-id` has been replaced with `control-id`, and `with-subcontrols` has been replaced by `with-child-controls` (on `call`, `all` and `match`). Essentially, a subcontrol is now represented as a control that is a child another parent control.

### Expanded model for new groups

Elements besides control references are now permitted inside `group` within the `merge` construct, so profile authors can provide titles and introductory content to groups they define for their represented aggregate control structures.

### Parameter settings

Added 'guideline' to profile model. It was omitted in error.

These data types are documented in the following sections.
Simple Data types empty This data type indicates that the model information element contains no value content, but may contain other structured information elements.
In XML, this may represent an element without text content.
In JSON, this may represent an object with labels corresponding to other child information elements, but no label corresponding to a text value.</description></item><item><title>OSCAL Release Notes</title><link>https://pages.nist.gov/OSCAL/reference/release-notes/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pages.nist.gov/OSCAL/reference/release-notes/</guid><description>OSCAL 1.0.0 Release The following changes were made in OSCAL 1.0.0 since OSCAL 1.0.0 Release Candidate (RC) 2.
Overall changes The following general changes were made in this release.
In prior releases for some JSON objects, an object's identifier was used as a property.
For example:
{ &amp;#34;identifer1&amp;#34;: { &amp;#34;comment&amp;#34;: &amp;#34;remainder of object 1&amp;#34; }, &amp;#34;identifer2&amp;#34;: { &amp;#34;comment&amp;#34;: &amp;#34;remainder of object 2&amp;#34; } } While this &amp;quot;BY_KEY&amp;quot; notation does enforce uniqueness of identifiers, this syntax is difficult to write parsers for.</description></item></channel></rss>
